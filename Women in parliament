## Women in parliament

You may have missed it, but 2019 has been full of historic turns in the usually so quiet and peaceful Switzerland. The country is famously known for its chocolate and cheese – as well, on a completely different topic, infamous for the year all Swiss women obtained the right to vote. For those of you who might have skipped Swiss history class, it is only on the 28th of April 1991 all Swiss women finally could vote and run for office on the cantonal and federal level. Twenty-eight years later, on the 14th of June 2019, around half a million people marched in multiple cities to demand actual gender equality on the occasion of the second national women’s strike. This event has not gone unnoticed in the political world: as the time came to cast a vote on the federal election citizens have elected an unprecedented number of women in the lower chamber of parliament. Resulting in the highest number of female parliamentarians so far and bringing the country from the 38th place on the ranking of percentage of women in national parliaments to the Xth spot. On the occasion of the 100 first days of the newly chosen parliament, we return to the sadly recent history of women in the lower chamber of Swiss parliament.
